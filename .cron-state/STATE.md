## TICK 2026-05-18 21:46 PT — MODE C v2.0.0 Slice 6 plan + Slice 6.1 scaffolding

Slice 6 (`slab.document.{onOpen,onClose,getActive}` event dispatch) is the trickiest piece in the Workshop arc because rquickjs runtimes aren't `Send` across `Context::with`, so dispatch needs a per-plugin actor thread. Spent this tick writing the ship-ready implementation plan (10 sub-tasks, ~1030 LOC est, full drop-order safety notes), and landing the first sub-task as scaffolding so future ticks have a stable starting point.

**Commits this tick:**
- `17d2cc1` docs(plans): v2.0.0 Slice 6 implementation plan — document lifecycle events
- `5941add` feat(plugins/runtime): RuntimeCmd + DocumentEvent actor types (v2.0.0 Slice 6.1)

**Slice 6 plan (`docs/plans/2026-05-18-v2.0.0-workshop-slice-6.md`, 1059 lines):**
- Architecture: per-plugin actor thread owns a long-lived `rquickjs::Runtime` + `Context`. Host sends `RuntimeCmd` over `crossbeam-channel`. `Persistent<Function>` is `Send + 'static` but the runtime is pinned to its spawn thread — that's why actors, not a global runtime.
- 10 sub-tasks: 6.1 types ✅, 6.2 PluginActor skeleton, 6.3 JS-side `onOpen/onClose` (stores `Persistent`), 6.4 `getActive()` reads shared `ActiveDoc`, 6.5 real `run_actor` body (init handshake + event loop + drop-order), 6.6 `PluginRuntimeRegistry` Tauri state, 6.7 Tauri commands, 6.8 frontend integration in `+page.svelte`, 6.9 10+ contract tests, 6.10 quality gates.
- Critical invariant called out explicitly: **`Persistent` handles MUST be cleared before the owning `Runtime` drops** or rquickjs aborts. Actor exit path: `lifecycle.clear()` → `drop(ctx)` → `drop(rt)`.

**Slice 6.1 (`5941add`) — scaffolding:**
- New `src-tauri/src/plugins/runtime/actor.rs` (141 LOC): `RuntimeCmd { DocumentOpened, DocumentClosed, Shutdown }`, `DocumentEvent { path, name }` with `from_path()` deriving name from `file_stem()`.
- 7 unit tests cover the stem-derivation edge cases (no extension, multi-dot like `archive.tar.gz` → `archive.tar`, dotfile `.bashrc` → `.bashrc`, root path → empty), `matches!(Shutdown)`, and a compile-time `Send + Clone + 'static` assertion. All pass.

**Quality gates on HEAD `5941add`:**
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` — clean
- `cargo clippy --lib --all-targets -- -D warnings` — clean
- `cargo test --lib` — **812 passed / 0 failed** (805 prior + 7 new actor tests)
- `pnpm check` — 0 errors, 35 pre-existing warnings (unchanged)

**Why a plan tick instead of full Slice 6:** Slice 6 touches lifetimes (`Persistent<Function<'static>>`), threading (one actor thread per plugin), and unsafe-adjacent drop ordering (`Persistent` outliving the runtime aborts the process). Writing 600+ LOC of that without a written design first would mean revising it in-flight. Plan-first means future ticks can dispatch focused sub-task subagents with zero ambiguity.

**Push:** in progress (see below).

Big vertical slice: typed manifest surface + standalone modal component + parent panel wiring + permission management actions — 3 commits, ~850 LOC net.

**Commits this tick:**
- `407e2c3` feat(plugins/ts): Manifest.runtime + ManifestCapabilities + consent i18n (v2.0.0 Slice 5a)
- `7b09f0f` feat(plugins/ui): PluginConsentModal component (v2.0.0 Slice 5b)
- `ad1d0d0` feat(plugins/ui): wire consent modal into enable flow + permission actions (v2.0.0 Slice 5c)

**Slice 5a (`407e2c3`) — typing + i18n prep:**
- `src/lib/plugins.ts`: added `Manifest.runtime: RuntimeManifest | null` mirror, plus new `RuntimeManifest` (entry/sha256/capabilities) and `ManifestCapabilities` (fs/net/ui/beacon + two allow-lists) interfaces. `ManifestCapabilities` is kept distinct from `PluginGrants` so the modal can enforce "user can dial down, not up" by comparing the two.
- `src/lib/i18n/en.json`: 36 new strings under `plugins.consent.*` + `plugins.permissions.*`. Other locales fall back to en.

**Slice 5b (`7b09f0f`) — modal component (510 lines):**
- New `src/lib/components/PluginConsentModal.svelte`. Pure presentational; no Tauri knowledge.
- Header: 🔐 icon + "Permissions for <name>" + default-deny subtitle.
- Per-cap rows (fs/net/ui/beacon) — render only when declared bound is non-`none`. Segmented radio with values from `none` up to declared max. 11px declared-hint shows what the plugin asked for.
- Allow-lists (fs paths, net hosts) surfaced read-only when the axis is non-`none`. Collapsed when set to `none`. Editing them lands in a follow-up slice.
- Helper `allowedValues<T>(order, max)` computes per-axis lattice prefix. `as const` tuples so the lattice is type-checked.
- On approve: scrubs allow-lists when axis is `none` (keeps grants file tidy).
- Esc + backdrop = Deny. Approve focused on mount.
- `noRuntime` short-circuit branch for declarative-only plugins (defensive — parent skips entirely for those).

**Slice 5c (`ad1d0d0`) — panel wiring (264 LOC added):**
- `toggleEnabled(p, true)` gates on `getPluginGrants(id).has_decision === false` for `[runtime]` plugins. First-enable → consent modal pre-fills with manifest's declared bounds (max-useful default).
- `ConsentModalState` carries plugin + optional `initial` grants + optional `onResolve` callback. Two flows: first-enable (initial=null, onResolve resumes enable) vs re-review (initial=current grants, onResolve=null).
- Approve: `setPluginGrants(id, grants)` + success toast + resume enable if pending.
- Deny: first-enable path persists `emptyPluginGrants()` (so we don't re-prompt) + info toast. Re-review path just closes without writing.
- Contrib drilldown gets a new "Permissions" row (only when `manifest.runtime !== null`) with "Review permissions" + "Reset permissions" link-buttons. Reset → `resetPluginGrants(id)` + toast explaining next-enable will re-prompt.
- `.permissions-row` CSS with dashed top-border for visual separation.

**Quality gates on `feature/v2.0.0-workshop` HEAD `ad1d0d0`:**
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` — clean
- `cargo clippy --lib --all-targets -- -D warnings` — clean
- `cargo test --lib` — **805 passed / 0 failed** (unchanged from Slice 4 — Slice 5 is frontend-only)
- `pnpm check` — 0 errors, 35 pre-existing warnings (unchanged in count + identity)

**Push:** in progress (see below).

## NEXT TICK PLAYBOOK

### Step 1 — MODE C continue v2.0.0 "Workshop"

**Slice 6.2 (PluginActor thread spawn) — NEXT:**
- Add `crossbeam-channel = "0.5"` to `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
- Add `PluginActor::spawn(plugin_id, declared, granted, source) -> Result<WorkerHandle, RuntimeError>`. For 6.2 the worker body is a placeholder that just drains commands and exits on `Shutdown` — real impl lands in 6.5.
- 2 contract tests: spawn + shutdown clean; spawn with bad source surfaces or swallows quietly (either is fine).
- Follow `docs/plans/2026-05-18-v2.0.0-workshop-slice-6.md` Task 6.2 verbatim.

**Slice 6.3 (`slab.document.on{Open,Close}` JS bindings):**
- New `runtime/lifecycle.rs` (`LifecycleRegistry` + `SharedLifecycle` type).
- Extend `HostBindings { lifecycle: Option<SharedLifecycle> }` — `None` for ephemeral `execute_script`, `Some` for actor paths.
- Replace the `make_unavailable("Slice 4b")` stubs at `slab.document.onOpen/onClose` with real handlers that take a callback `Function` and stash it as `Persistent::save(&ctx, f)`.

**Slice 6.4+ — see plan doc** for the full arc through frontend wiring.

### Step 2 — Watch for sibling subagent activity

Sibling subagents can touch `/tmp/msg.txt`. Always overwrite right before commit.

## TICK MODE DECISION TREE

```
1. Read STATE.md
2. RELEASE_PENDING in STATE.md + CI run → MODE B (poll CI; if green, gh release create)
3. Any feature/* branch with STATUS: DONE → MODE A (merge to main + tag + push)
4. No pending release, no DONE branch → MODE C (DEVELOP — ship a vertical slice)
```

## POST-v1.9 ROADMAP REMINDERS

**v1.9.3** — Windows-native STT (WASAPI via cpal). Real implementation, not the `todo!()` scaffold from v1.9.2 T6. Cargo feature `windows-stt`. ~3-4 commits + integration tests.

**v2.0.0 "Workshop" slice progress:**
- ✅ Slice 2 (manifest schema + hash-pinned loader) — shipped 2026-05-18
- ✅ Slice 1 (rquickjs embedding + sandboxed console) — shipped 2026-05-18
- ✅ Slice 3 (capability grants backend + enforce()) — shipped 2026-05-18
- ✅ Slice 4 (`slab` global + lifecycle + Tauri grant cmds + TS bindings) — shipped 2026-05-18
- ✅ Slice 5 (Cabinet consent modal + enable integration) — shipped 2026-05-18
- 🟡 Slice 6 (document lifecycle events) — **plan written, 6.1 types shipped**, 6.2-6.10 pending
- ⏭ Slices 7-12 — see plan doc

Slices in target order: 1→rquickjs+console ✅, 2→manifest schema ✅, 3→capability backend ✅, 4→`slab` global + lifecycle ✅, 5→Cabinet consent modal ✅, 6→event dispatch 🟡 (6.1/10), 7→fetch shim, 8→storage, 9→SDK npm pkg, 10→sample plugin+docs, 11→AI provider registration, 12→release.

**v2.1.0 candidates (post-Workshop):**
- **Forge** — author-signed plugins. Wants 10+ plugins in curated index before considering (Sanjay's flag).
- **Slab CLI** — `slab plugin install <url>`.
- **Plugin author cookbook** — recipes for common plugin patterns.

**Parked items (pre-existing):**
- `docs/screenshots-v1.3.1/` working copy in repo root — harmless, can `rm -rf` someday.
- CommandPalette DETACHABLE_PANELS drift — missing citations/study/glossary entries pre-existed v1.9.0; voice was added but the other three remain. Quick cleanup tick someday.
- Sanjay's external action for v1.4.1: create `Sanjays2402/slab-plugins` GH repo, drop seed files from `docs/marketplace-seed/`, sign the hello-slab plugin, post first real `index.json`.
