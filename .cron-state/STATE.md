## TICK 2026-05-18 21:05 PT — MODE C v2.0.0 Slice 5 (Cabinet consent modal + enable integration)

Big vertical slice: typed manifest surface + standalone modal component + parent panel wiring + permission management actions — 3 commits, ~850 LOC net.

**Commits this tick:**
- `407e2c3` feat(plugins/ts): Manifest.runtime + ManifestCapabilities + consent i18n (v2.0.0 Slice 5a)
- `7b09f0f` feat(plugins/ui): PluginConsentModal component (v2.0.0 Slice 5b)
- `ad1d0d0` feat(plugins/ui): wire consent modal into enable flow + permission actions (v2.0.0 Slice 5c)

**Slice 5a (`407e2c3`) — typing + i18n prep:**
- `src/lib/plugins.ts`: added `Manifest.runtime: RuntimeManifest | null` mirror, plus new `RuntimeManifest` (entry/sha256/capabilities) and `ManifestCapabilities` (fs/net/ui/beacon + two allow-lists) interfaces. `ManifestCapabilities` is kept distinct from `PluginGrants` so the modal can enforce "user can dial down, not up" by comparing the two.
- `src/lib/i18n/en.json`: 36 new strings under `plugins.consent.*` + `plugins.permissions.*`. Other locales fall back to en.

**Slice 5b (`7b09f0f`) — modal component (510 lines):**
- New `src/lib/components/PluginConsentModal.svelte`. Pure presentational; no Tauri knowledge.
- Header: 🔐 icon + "Permissions for <name>" + default-deny subtitle.
- Per-cap rows (fs/net/ui/beacon) — render only when declared bound is non-`none`. Segmented radio with values from `none` up to declared max. 11px declared-hint shows what the plugin asked for.
- Allow-lists (fs paths, net hosts) surfaced read-only when the axis is non-`none`. Collapsed when set to `none`. Editing them lands in a follow-up slice.
- Helper `allowedValues<T>(order, max)` computes per-axis lattice prefix. `as const` tuples so the lattice is type-checked.
- On approve: scrubs allow-lists when axis is `none` (keeps grants file tidy).
- Esc + backdrop = Deny. Approve focused on mount.
- `noRuntime` short-circuit branch for declarative-only plugins (defensive — parent skips entirely for those).

**Slice 5c (`ad1d0d0`) — panel wiring (264 LOC added):**
- `toggleEnabled(p, true)` gates on `getPluginGrants(id).has_decision === false` for `[runtime]` plugins. First-enable → consent modal pre-fills with manifest's declared bounds (max-useful default).
- `ConsentModalState` carries plugin + optional `initial` grants + optional `onResolve` callback. Two flows: first-enable (initial=null, onResolve resumes enable) vs re-review (initial=current grants, onResolve=null).
- Approve: `setPluginGrants(id, grants)` + success toast + resume enable if pending.
- Deny: first-enable path persists `emptyPluginGrants()` (so we don't re-prompt) + info toast. Re-review path just closes without writing.
- Contrib drilldown gets a new "Permissions" row (only when `manifest.runtime !== null`) with "Review permissions" + "Reset permissions" link-buttons. Reset → `resetPluginGrants(id)` + toast explaining next-enable will re-prompt.
- `.permissions-row` CSS with dashed top-border for visual separation.

**Quality gates on `feature/v2.0.0-workshop` HEAD `ad1d0d0`:**
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` — clean
- `cargo clippy --lib --all-targets -- -D warnings` — clean
- `cargo test --lib` — **805 passed / 0 failed** (unchanged from Slice 4 — Slice 5 is frontend-only)
- `pnpm check` — 0 errors, 35 pre-existing warnings (unchanged in count + identity)

**Push:** in progress (see below).

## NEXT TICK PLAYBOOK

### Step 1 — MODE C continue v2.0.0 "Workshop"

**Slice 6 (real `slab.document` lifecycle + event dispatch) — NEXT:**
- Build a per-plugin `Persistent<Function>` table inside a new `RuntimeRegistry` keyed by plugin_id. Each `slab.document.onOpen(fn)` registration stores `fn` here so it can be called later from the Rust side.
- Fire `onOpen` / `onClose` from PDF loader sites — find the spot in `src-tauri/src/pdf/loader.rs` (or wherever) where a doc enters/leaves the active set; iterate the registry and invoke each plugin's persistent function.
- Tricky bit: `Persistent<Function<'_>>` lifetime — write the `unsafe impl JsLifetime` carefully with tests upfront. The Slice 4 doc note "deferred to a future slice" is explicitly calling out this work.
- Capability check: each invocation must run inside the plugin's existing `Context` (not a fresh one) — handlers might close over state from the initial install_slab() pass.

ETA: full tick. Write 3+ contract tests upfront (register → fire → handler runs → fire again → handler still runs → unregister → handler doesn't run).

**Slice 7 (fetch shim respecting net grants) — after Slice 6:**
- `slab.fetch(url, opts)` JS shim — proxies through Rust `reqwest` after `enforce_net()` check against the plugin's grants.
- HTTPS-only for safety. Timeout + size caps.
- Returns `{ ok, status, headers, text(), json() }` (subset of Web Fetch).

**Slice 8+ — see plan doc** (storage, SDK npm, sample plugin, AI provider registration, release).

### Step 2 — Watch for sibling subagent activity

(Same warning — sibling subagents can touch `/tmp/msg.txt`. Always overwrite right before commit.)

## TICK MODE DECISION TREE

```
1. Read STATE.md
2. RELEASE_PENDING in STATE.md + CI run → MODE B (poll CI; if green, gh release create)
3. Any feature/* branch with STATUS: DONE → MODE A (merge to main + tag + push)
4. No pending release, no DONE branch → MODE C (DEVELOP — ship a vertical slice)
```

## POST-v1.9 ROADMAP REMINDERS

**v1.9.3** — Windows-native STT (WASAPI via cpal). Real implementation, not the `todo!()` scaffold from v1.9.2 T6. Cargo feature `windows-stt`. ~3-4 commits + integration tests.

**v2.0.0 "Workshop" slice progress:**
- ✅ Slice 2 (manifest schema + hash-pinned loader) — shipped 2026-05-18
- ✅ Slice 1 (rquickjs embedding + sandboxed console) — shipped 2026-05-18
- ✅ Slice 3 (capability grants backend + enforce()) — shipped 2026-05-18
- ✅ Slice 4 (`slab` global + lifecycle + Tauri grant cmds + TS bindings) — shipped 2026-05-18
- ✅ Slice 5 (Cabinet consent modal + enable integration) — shipped 2026-05-18
- ⏭ Slice 6 (Persistent<Function> event dispatch — onOpen/onClose) — NEXT
- ⏭ Slices 7-12 — see plan doc

Slices in target order: 1→rquickjs+console ✅, 2→manifest schema ✅, 3→capability backend ✅, 4→`slab` global + lifecycle ✅, 5→Cabinet consent modal ✅, 6→event dispatch, 7→fetch shim, 8→storage, 9→SDK npm pkg, 10→sample plugin+docs, 11→AI provider registration, 12→release.

**v2.1.0 candidates (post-Workshop):**
- **Forge** — author-signed plugins. Wants 10+ plugins in curated index before considering (Sanjay's flag).
- **Slab CLI** — `slab plugin install <url>`.
- **Plugin author cookbook** — recipes for common plugin patterns.

**Parked items (pre-existing):**
- `docs/screenshots-v1.3.1/` working copy in repo root — harmless, can `rm -rf` someday.
- CommandPalette DETACHABLE_PANELS drift — missing citations/study/glossary entries pre-existed v1.9.0; voice was added but the other three remain. Quick cleanup tick someday.
- Sanjay's external action for v1.4.1: create `Sanjays2402/slab-plugins` GH repo, drop seed files from `docs/marketplace-seed/`, sign the hello-slab plugin, post first real `index.json`.
